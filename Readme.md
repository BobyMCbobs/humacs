## Philosophy<a id="sec-1-2"></a>

Vanilla Emacs is inaccessable to most humans, therefore the power of Org mode based documentation and workflows is unavailable.

Literate programming and DevOps when combined together make the documentation also executable - meaning for reproducable easily documented creations.
